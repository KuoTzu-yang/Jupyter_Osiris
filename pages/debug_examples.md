# Debugging module

As stated in the Section 5.4, OSIRIS the targeted failure debugging module of Osiris aims to locate the suspicious statements (which is likely to induce non-reproducibility). Currently, it will return the line index of the first found suspicious statement.  

Below examples demonstrate the usage of our debugging module, where source code of notebooks are also provided.
