Pandas is one of the most powerful contributions to python for quick and easy data analysis. Data Science is dominated by
one common data structure - the table. Python never had a great native way to manipulate tables in ways that many analysts
are used to (if you're at all familliar with spreadsheets or relational databases). The basic Pandas data structure is the Data 
Frame which, if you are an R user, should sound familliar.

This module is a very high level treatment of basic data operations one typically uses when manipulating tables in Python. 
To really learn all of the details, refer to the book.

#To import
import pandas as pd #Its common to use pd as the abbreviation
from pandas import Series, DataFrame #Wes McKinney recommends importing these separately - they are used so often and benefit from having their own namespace

'''
The Series - for this module we'll skip the Series (see book for details), but we will define it. A Series is a one dimensional
array like object that has an array plus an index, which labels the array entries. Once we present a Data Frame, one can think
of a series as similar to a Data Frame with just one column.

'''
A simple example of the DataFrame - building one from a dictionary
(note for this to work each list has to be the same length)
'''
data = {'state':['OH', 'OH', 'OH', 'NV', 'NV'], 
        'year':[2000, 2001, 2002, 2001, 2002],
        'pop':[1.5, 1.7, 3.6, 2.4, 2.9]}

frame = pd.DataFrame(data) #This function will turn the dict to the data frame. Notice that the keys become columns and an index is created
